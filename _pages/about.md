We are a computational research group in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Our interdisciplinary research lies at the interface of chemical engineering, applied mathematics, and data science. There are two intertwined aspects of the research carried out in our group. The first aspect includes developing and employing PSE techniques to discover advanced materials and pathways to produce electricity, fuels, and chemicals economically and sustainably. Second, we develop theory and algorithms to solve challenging application-driven optimization problems.

Current areas of research interests include:
* Multi-scale optimization of solar thermal energy systems
* Decarbonization of the Indian energy system
* Hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models
* Optimization theory and algorithms for large-scale nonconvex problems 

We are expanding our research group and I am looking for motivated Postdoctoral Research Fellows, Ph.D., Masters, and Dual-degree students. Interested candidates can reach out to me via email at ibajaj@iitk.ac.in.
