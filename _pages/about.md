We are a computational research group in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Our interdisciplinary research lies at the interface of chemical engineering, applied mathematics, and data science. There are two intertwined aspects of the research carried out in our group. The first aspect includes developing and employing PSE techniques to discover advanced materials and pathways to produce electricity, fuels, and chemicals economically and sustainably. Second, we develop theory and algorithms to solve challenging application-driven optimization problems.
Current projects include:
* Multi-scale optimization of solar thermal energy systems
* Decarbonization of the Indian energy system
* Hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models
* Optimization theory and algorithms for large-scale nonconvex problems
